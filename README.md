Some wallpapers that i made... Source code is provided.

Works on windows 8 - 10.

Should work on any resolution, although might look weird on 2K and 4K or just like 1920x1080 resolution.

Source code is in codeblocks (Code blocks project file), but is easy enough to link for other ide-s.

WARNING: To close the program open task manager (Ctrl + Shift + Escape), find Wallpaper.exe and close it. Then reset windows explorer or change background in windows personalization dialog to reset desktop background.
